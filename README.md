# Flappy-Bird
The project contains code to a game called "Flappy Bird". 
Flappy Bird is a game where a player controls a bird to dodge incoming pipes by going between them. Once you hit a pipe, you are out.

To get started with the project, simply download all the files and run the file called "flappybird.py". 
This will automatically bring you to a screen where the game will start. 
Press 'SPACE' to control the bird's vertical location to dodge the incoming pipes.

highscore.txt keeps track of your high score of all time (reset by pressing 'H').
total_coins.txt keeps track of your coins of all time (reset by pressing 'c').

CAUTION:
- Coins are sometimes spawned in places impossible to reach (sorry!)
- Pipes do not fill the full screen as intended (Couldn't figure it out sorry!)
- Sometimes have to spam 'R' to restart game (Sometimes glitches, couldn't find a fix sorry!)
